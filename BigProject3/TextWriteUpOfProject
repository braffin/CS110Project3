This Casino Driver asks the User for a name to call themselves.
Then, it asks which game they want to play: BlacJack, War, or Craps.
Whichever the game the user clicks, it runs that game one time, and asks if the user wants to play again
clicking yes plays again, clicking no returns the user to the title screen to pick a new game.
At the end of each game, the user is declared the winner or loser, and the number of times the user won or lost 
		are stored to be reopened and added to if the game is played again later.
